        <h1>Hawaiian Beach Shrimp</h1>
        <p>This recipe is great for hibachi on the beach or in your backyard. You can also broil it in your oven if you're not in Hawaii or near a beach. It's a easy way to prepare a shrimp dish that's 'ono' (delicious) and moist! 
            You can serve this either as an appetizer (pupu) or entree. I prepare it either with or without the shells on - depending on how fast I want people to eat 'um up! Aloha from Hawaii!!! Enjoy!
