        <h1>Perfect Chicken</h1>
        <p>Chicken stock, wine, onions, garlic, mushroom, cream, butter, herbs, lemon, and capers reduce to make a perfect sauce. 
            Served alongside mushroom rice and asparagus; it is HEAVEN! Patience is key with the sauce. The flavors will come together beautifully if you allow them to reduce as directed.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Serves 4</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup white wine</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried sage</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
            <li>½ cup cornstarch, or as needed</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
             <li>Pour the chicken broth into a saucepan with the onion and garlic; bring to a boil and cook at a boil until the liquid reduces by half, about 10 minutes. Pour in the white wine, return to a boil, 
                 and reduce the liquid by half again, about 10 minutes. Stir in mushrooms, rosemary, and sage; simmer until the mushrooms are tender and have given up their juice, about 15 more minutes. Stir in cream, butter, 
                 lemon, and capers; reduce heat and simmer the sauce until thickened, about 10 minutes (45 minutes in all).</li>
             <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
             <li>Place the cornstarch into a shallow bowl and press the chicken thighs into the cornstarch on all sides until thoroughly coated. Shake off excess cornstarch. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; 
                 pan-fry the chicken thighs until they develop a golden brown crust, about 8 minutes per side. Place the chicken thighs into a 9x9-inch baking dish and pour the sauce over the chicken.</li>
             <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chicken thigh should read at 
                 least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
